                <figcaption id="ho__img-caption">Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a
                    passion for inquiry that eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of
                    relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric
                    effect and immigrated to the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis.
                    Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with his work
                    also having a major impact on the development of atomic energy. With a focus on unified field theory
                    during his later years, Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.</figcaption>

            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1905</strong> - postulated that light itself consists of localized particles</li>
                <li><strong>1911</strong> - Einstein published an article On the Influence of Gravitation on the
                    Propagation of
                    Light</li>
                <li><strong>1917</strong> - Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the
                    universe
                    as a whole</li>
                <li><strong>1929</strong> - Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two
                    dynamic models
                    of the cosmos</li>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of
                    matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter</li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often
                    called Einstein–Rosen bridges</li>
            </ul>
